"""Blackwater Mud Pie

There's a pie recipe that uses American river mud but I took my inspiration from closer to home when putting
together an entry to the 2023 MERG Oxford Event Cake Tin Challenge. Work was suspended when the 2023 event was
cancelled. However I've decided to complete it for the 2024 event.

This miniature layout features Tollesbury Pier Station.  Lying on the north bank of the Blackwater Estuary,
this was at the southern end of the Kelvedon and Tollesbury Light Railway until the station's closure in 1921.

Conventional drives mechanisms are difficult to engineer in a locomotive whose overall length at this
scale is about 16mm and so the propulsion mechanism
here is a magnetic linear motor which is controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico. This also provides a simple
user interface for human operations.

I've used 3D printing extensively for the rolling stock, track, lineside features and other scenic items as well
the infrastructure used in the layout's construction.

As there is no cake tin challenge in 2024 I've undone some of the compromises necessary to fit
the layout in a cake tin.  It now needs a somewhat larger pie dish.
